# MachineLearning

In this repository you will find:
* Different machine learning algorithms and features in different programming languages
* Each folder will represent a specific programming language

Each Folder should have a library subfolder containing:
- Matrix Class (with Matrix operations)
- Math Class (containg activation functions, other Math functions not found in respective language)
- Algorithms Class (such linear/logistic regression, ...)
- NeuralNetwork Class (containing feedforward prop, backward prop, training func...)
